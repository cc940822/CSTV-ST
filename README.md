# CSTV-ST
Code for A non-prior total variation compressed sensing model to interpolate soil properties with sparse measurements/n
data/raw: the raw data of EC-G400, EC-Rand and AOI in the manuscript
data/processed: the running results of EC_case/coord_trans2_CS.m, which transform the raw data into the CS framework.
EC_case/interpolate: a real case used to illustrate the feasibility of CSTV.
scr: providing the necessary functions used in CSTV modeling.
